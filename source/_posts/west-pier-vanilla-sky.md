Brighton’s derelict West Pier.

After a somewhat disappointing trek down to the pebble beach at dawn, I returned near sunset to try again. This time the sky was doing all sorts of crazy things, changing from dark black with the threat of hale (behind me), to these wonderful warm clouds over the ruined pier.
