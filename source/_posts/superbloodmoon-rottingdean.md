A slightly different take on the super-blood-moon eclipse. Here the moon is set against the silhouette of Rottingdean Windmill. A photo was taken every 4 minutes between 2am and 3am as the moon moved through the sky, and into Earth’s shadow. These shots were then stitched together to show all the eclipse’s phases in one image.
