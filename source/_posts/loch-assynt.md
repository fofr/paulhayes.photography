Loch Assynt and the ruins of a double gabled house in the Scottish Highlands. This was shortly after dawn, and the sun was striking the clouds and creating a magenta hue. It was about -7°C.

Acclaimed landscape photographer Ian Cameron was our guide for a [two day private tour](http://sam-and-paul.com/2015/01/landscape-photography-scottish-highlands/3/) in the North West Scottish highlands.

> Soon the light began to change, the edges of the clouds started to catch the earliest light and turn a subtle pink. This only grew stronger, and pinker; quickly the cloud edges were a radiant pink, while the undersides turned a deep purple. The loch in front caught the luminous light beautifully, turning a mystical cyan–magenta colour.
