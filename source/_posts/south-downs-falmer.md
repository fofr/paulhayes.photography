Our first trip out to Falmer and Castle Hill to see what the South Downs have to offer in that direction. It was a hazy afternoon, and we were mostly out for some fresh air, a good 10km hike and to scout for future photo locations. This was one of the locations, a field glowing green against the rest of the hazy afternoon.
