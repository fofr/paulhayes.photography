The conditions for bluebells were perfect this April. In Blackbrook Woods the forest floors were carpeted with these British favourites. The woods are near to Ditchling, Sussex, with a hidden entrance near the intersection of Middleton Common lane and Spatham lane.

I visited in the late evening and at dawn, and prepped with wellies as the mud can get quite deep in places.

In the woods I looked for a shot that showed the depth and volume of bluebells, while trying to catch the evening light on an interesting subject, like the young leaves on this tree.
