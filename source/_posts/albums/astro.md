{% photo centre-of-our-galaxy %}
The position of Mars on the far right created a triangle, which the dark horse nebula seems to point to. By the next new moon Mars had moved and the composition couldn't be re-created.

Seen from North Island in the Seychelles, this is a composite of 10 shots, each 11 seconds long and taken at ISO 6400. They have been combined to reduce noise.
