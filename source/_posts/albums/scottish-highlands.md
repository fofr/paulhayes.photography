For my 30th birthday, in the cold grips of winter, I was treated to a trip up to Ullapool in the remote north-west of Scotland, for two days of photography with [Ian Cameron](http://www.transientlight.co.uk/). Full details of our trip are available on [my travel blog](http://sam-and-paul.com/2015/01/landscape-photography-scottish-highlands/).

At dawn, a balmy -7C, we waited for the sun to come up. The light began to change, the edges of the clouds started to catch the earliest light and turn pink.

A snowy hut in the late afternoon sun, sat amidst wintery grasses and a backdrop of snow-peaked Cul Mor. The snow was pristine yet shallow enough to have texture. This quirky old building made an interesting foreground.

Sandy dunes, frozen pools and one of Scotlandâ€™s most glamorous panoramas.

Ice on a beach is a peculiar and rare thing and where the water was shallowest the ice had left interesting mottled patterns and textures in the sand.
