On a Wednesday afternoon at the beginning of November I visited an old favourite, the [National Trustâ€™s Sheffield Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sheffield-park-and-garden). I caught the end of autumn shortly before Storm Angus ripped through and tore off all the leaves.

As the sun set on a clear, crisp day, the yellow and orange leaves took on a life of their own.
