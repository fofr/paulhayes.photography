All day there were strong winds and fluffy clouds sailing by, so as the sun set I hoped to capture some of that movement with a long exposure of Brighton Pavilion.

Most of the clouds seemed to pass by to the right, which was frustrating, but I did eventually get some trails that emanated from the pavilion.
