It was forecast to be cold and frosty, with clear blue skies. I got up at 6am and set off towards The Seven Sisters for dawn.

There were little pools of water, all frozen. Birds were sitting on the ice, but in some places the surface had frozen only wafer thin, and it was melting again already.

At the sea the tide was heading out, and already a fair way back. On the pebbles I looked East towards sunrise and the seven beautiful cliffs, undulating into the distance.
