A seal, posing in the evening sun near Stranraer.

Sunning itself on an old pipe, it quizzically looked at us, occasionally glancing to see if we were too close. Balancing on the pipe it posed; looking left, looking right, now up – thank you; a seal glamour shoot. Then it flopped back into the water and swam out to sea, its head bobbing above the surface.
