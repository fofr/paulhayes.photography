Up early on a Sunday morning to explore again. After a no-show by the sea in Saltdean (the tide was too high for the composition I wanted and low cloud blocked the sunrise from view) I gave up and headed to Devil's Dyke. By the time I got there the sun was high enough and strong enough to pierce through the mist, creating some lovely light.
