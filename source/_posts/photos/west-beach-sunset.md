North Island is a remote private island in Seychelles. I was lucky enough to volunteer here as a wildlife conservationist for [4 weeks](http://sam-and-paul.com/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/). West Beach is almost always empty, and I enjoyed many quiet sunsets by the sea, like this one.

The ring of wooden stakes in the foreground is a Green Turtle nest, it's been marked out to prevent people from walking over it.
