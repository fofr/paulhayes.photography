Excerpt from [travel blog](https://sam-and-paul.com/2011/12/iguacu-falls-brazil/):

> Then we reached Garganta do Diablo, where there is a walkway right out into the middle of the thundering waterfalls. The spray from the falls is like heavy rainfall, and walking out you are going to get soaked. We braved it with our bags and Sam donned a poncho for the occasion, I risked the camera too in it’s waterproof bag. Out into the falls we eked, the cold refreshing water driving into our faces, water drops trickling down our cheeks, soaking and delighting us. From the edge of the final platform you can look right down into the abyss, where the river plunges deeper into the darkness, so far and so deep all you can see is the rebounding spray and the occasional crazy swallow flying into the waterfall.
