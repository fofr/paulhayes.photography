It was early, and as a volunteer I was on the lookout for buffalo herds, we needed to count and sex them. Zululand was in the middle of its worst drought in 60 years, and the herds were suffering. We came across this young white rhino calf and its protective mother. I was struck by the pale colour of the young baby and the dark aged skin of its parent. These rhinos are suffering too, they are underweight, the drought has left them little to eat.
