An excerpt from [my travel blog](https://sam-and-paul.com/2010/10/cadaques-spain/):

> Cadaques just oozes serenity, waves wash against small beaches and coves, scooters whiz along the one-way beach roads whilst golden brown Spaniards light up and coolly puff their smoke into the air.

> The town and cathedral sit pretty at the foot of towering mountains, the sun bakes the terracotta rooftops, whilst kids climb on the Dali statue in the centre. Open air restaurants secure the latest fishermen’s catch, and most menus include Paella.
