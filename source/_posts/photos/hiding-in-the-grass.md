While [volunteering at Tembe Elephant Park](https://sam-and-paul.com/tembe-elephant-park/) I travelled to the secluded north, towards the Mozambique border, to change some camera traps. The traps were placed to monitor lions in the harder to reach parts of the reserve. On route I found two young adult lions. This lionness was with her brother and it was the first time she'd been seen away from her mother. The siblings were now hunting without her.

I was struck by her perfect camouflage against the long brown grass, which grows from a bed of sand.
