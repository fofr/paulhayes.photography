From [our trip to the Longsheng rice terraces](https://sam-and-paul.com/2014/09/longsheng-rice-terraces-china/) in Guanxi, China.

> Before travelling here we knew that the rice terraces were best in May, when the paddies are filled with water and are reflective. We expected a full green crop of rice, we didn’t know that as autumn approaches the rice turns golden yellow, two weeks before it’s harvested. This yellow rice, which ripples through the terraces is spectacular, and a photographer’s dream come true. Our caravan of 8 hiked through these incredible scenes, onwards and upwards, until we reached Píng’ān.
