For the first time in almost two years, The South Downs near Brighton had a flurry of snow. When I arrived it was a winter wonderland, and families arrived with their sleds and skis to make the most of it. By 11am the falling snow had stopped, and was turning to rain, and by mid-afternoon all traces of snow were gone.
