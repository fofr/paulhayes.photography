An excerpt from my [travel blog](http://sam-and-paul.com/2015/09/southern-scotland/4/):

> We were aiming for the Red Deer Park, but were stopped by the perfectly still and reflecting Clatteringshaws reservoir.

> Rushing down to the water’s edge, tripod banging against the floor as we scrambled over the rocks, we hurried to find a composition and capture the scene. After 10 minutes we needed to be on our way, and as a sign the wind picked up; all the reflections disappeared, replaced by endless ripples.
