An excerpt from [my travel blog](https://sam-and-paul.com/mkhuze-south-africa/3/):

> We arrive to find a recently killed and otherwise untouched female impala, a female cheetah is resting nearby – recovering from the hunt, she hasn’t started feeding; from her markings we ID her as MCF13 – not seen since July. We sit and watch patiently.

Mkhuze, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
