Night time view on a clear evening from [Victoria Peak, Hong Kong](https://sam-and-paul.com/2014/09/hong-kong-china/).

> An old tram near the station has free maps of the area, showing all the walks — where to go for viewpoints and how to walk down if you wanted to. We headed west along the quiet and lovely Lugard trail (盧吉道), a circular route 400m above sea level offering fabulous panoramic views over Victoria harbour. It’s a road, sort of, too narrow for cars but some vehicles have permits to use it; but that means there’s no benches to perch on, so we sat on the concrete floor to eat our lunch (though by now it was dinner time), with views out between the railings of the International Commerce Centre and One Island East.
