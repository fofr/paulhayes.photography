Isn't he beautiful? The [resplendent quetzal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resplendent_quetzal) is top of many birders’ lists for their trip to Costa Rica. This was in the Santa Elena Cloud Forest, near Monteverde.

One of the hardest pictures I’ve had to take. This beautiful and rare bird was sitting in the perfect place – for composition. Taking the shot was a bit harder; my view point was from a hanging bridge, a bridge that kept swaying as people moved, it was quite dark, and I was trying to use a 400mm zoom.
