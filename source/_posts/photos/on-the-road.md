For 8 weeks I monitored endangered African wild dogs as a volunteer. We used VHF radio collars to track and find each pack of dogs, assessing their health, diet and behaviour. This pair of dogs were leading the pack on their morning hunt, briefly stopping to wait for the stragglers, it was the perfect moment to capture. The stragglers passed by me as I took the photograph, and the pack of 5 soon disappeared over the hill.
