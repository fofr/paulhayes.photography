Mottled ice on the Brae of Achnahaird in the North West of Scotland. Ice on a beach is a peculiar and rare thing and where the water was shallowest the ice had left interesting mottled patterns and textures in the sand. This became our final subject, and as the night closed in and the temperatures dropped we began to feel the cold. We noticed that the ice patches had visibly grown whilst we’d been there. Setting the heavy tripods up on the ice was a hoot, with legs sprawled, we could slide the pod about the icy surface and quickly find the composition we wanted; photography on ice.

Acclaimed landscape photographer Ian Cameron was our guide for a [two day private tour](https://sam-and-paul.com/2015/01/landscape-photography-scottish-highlands/3/) in the North West Scottish highlands.
