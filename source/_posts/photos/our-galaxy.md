Last night I visited Beachy Head in hopes of dark skies and brilliant stars. My aim was to come away with my first alright picture of the Milky Way (not worrying too much about foreground). This shot is comprised of 15 exposures, each at 15s at ISO 12800. They were then aligned and stacked, and I used a median filter to remove noise.
