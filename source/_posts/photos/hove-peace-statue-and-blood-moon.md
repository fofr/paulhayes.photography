The [Hove Peace Statue](http://www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk/object?id=60), a monument to Edward VII, against the red of a super blood wolf moon.

Taken in the early hours of a cold January morning, with fingers numb, and temperatures around -2C, I watched as the moon changed from white to red as the earth blocked out the light.
