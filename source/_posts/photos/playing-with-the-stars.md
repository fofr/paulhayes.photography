While up on Spa Hill, part of [North Island, Seychelles](https://sam-and-paul.com/2016/08/north-island-seychelles/), after a standard night time photography session I played with some self portraits.

Positioning the camera and tripod below me on the hill, I used a remote shutter on my phone to create this composition; I had to guess roughly where the star was so it would look like I was holding it.

Once of the more enjoyable photos I've taken, even if it did come out a little noisy.
