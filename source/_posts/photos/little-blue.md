Where Cahuita National Park meets the Caribbean Sea I waited for the sun to rise. Sitting at the water’s edge with my morning coffee I watched this charming little blue heron walk up and down the shoreline. Its feet were in the water, and with each retreating wave it searched intently for a meal. As the first light caught the ripples on the surface I captured this image of it silhouetted against the sea. Then it caught a fish, swallowed it whole and flew away, I finished my coffee and set off to explore the forest.
