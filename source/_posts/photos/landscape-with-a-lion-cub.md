Tembe Elephant Park is a sand forest; its vegetation is unique and beautiful and I took some time to photograph this autumnal scene. It was while composing this image that a lion cub peered through the gap and completed the picture. If you look carefully to the right there is a hidden second pair of eyes. It is always unnerving to discover you're being watched by lions. This cub was one of 4 with her mother.
