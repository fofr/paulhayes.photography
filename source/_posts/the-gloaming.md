These are the low lying fields of Ivinghoe, as seen from Ivinghoe beacon. After finding my composition I needed to wait an hour for the gaps in the cloud to eventually align, letting the sunlight stream through and giving me the image I was after. The light disappeared within a minute, and didn’t return.
