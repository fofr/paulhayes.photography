A tiny house in Elphin, Assynt, Scotland. Behind the rickety old house lies Cul Mor mountain.

Acclaimed landscape photographer Ian Cameron was our guide for a [two day private tour](http://sam-and-paul.com/2015/01/landscape-photography-scottish-highlands/3/) in the North West Scottish highlands. Ian brought us here, to Elphin, in perfect snowy conditions.

> Driving through the highland roads, the snow-peaked mountains looked glorious against a blue sky with wispy warm clouds. On route to our planned final stop Ian was looking out for a small building near the roadside that he’d photographed before. It sat on the outskirts of Elphin, a “crofting township”, 15 miles north of Ullapool. It’s really very tiny, and the building itself was practically a hut, with some old billowing curtains.
