From [our autumnal trip to Jiuzhaigou](http://sam-and-paul.com/2014/09/jiuzhaigou-huanglong-china/2/) in Sichuan province, China.

> From a remote trail near Nuorilang waterfall we found Mirror Lake (镜海, Jìng Hǎi), as you might imagine, it’s famous for its perfect reflections. Beneath the calm surface fallen trees spread out in a curious underwater landscape, the water is so clear and blue you can see deep into the lake. The yellowing autumnal colours across the lake also created a sublime image.
