I’d like to trial a hands-on Astrophotography workshop with a few photographers in Sussex, based either at Seven Sisters or up on Devil’s Dyke.

The session will need clear skies, a new moon and fairly low wind. So it might be a little awkward to organise, but I’m willing to try.

I think the session could focus on:

* camera settings
* maximum exposure length
* over-exposing for light pollution
* star focussing using a diffraction filter
* using an equatorial mount for wide field photos
* lens choice
* star trails
* a brief guide to post-processing

You’d need to bring:

* camera
* tripod
* remote shutter
* warm clothes

The first session will be free, as it’ll mostly be an experiment.

Please email me if you’re interested: {% contact %}
