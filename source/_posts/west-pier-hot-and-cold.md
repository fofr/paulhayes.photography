I've taken many pictures of the West Pier this weekend, to see what I can make of a subject that is photographed hundreds of times a day.

This is the final one from this weekend, and it's one that pushed the camera a lot. It's a single shot panorama (cropped) without HDR. I used a 3 stop Hitech filter and a 0.45 hard edge filter.

I like how the image is both cold and hot, capturing that "orange and teal" look [modern movies and posters often simulate](http://priceonomics.com/why-every-movie-looks-sort-of-orange-and-blue/).
