This lighthouse in Scotland appears to illuminate the night sky, revealing our galaxy, The Milky Way, and in the distance, the faint glow of Andromeda too.

Shining upwards, and outwards – to the stars and countless other worlds. Consider how many beings might live within those few small pixels that are Andromeda, 2.5 million light years away.
